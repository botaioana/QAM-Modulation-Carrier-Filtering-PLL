# QAM-Modulation-Carrier-Filtering-PLL
This project simulates a QAM system, generating a Gray-coded QAM constellation and extracting the carrier using signal processing techniques. It includes carrier extraction, filtering, and PLL synchronization, with plans for higher-order QAM and advanced processing.
